%\item Implemented genetic algorithm in Perl to find motifs in \textit{C. elegans} worm DNA linked to higher gene expression, i.e. protein production.
\item Developed genetic algorithm in Perl that locates DNA subsequences linked to higher gene expression based on Kullback-Leibler divergence.
\item Paper draft titled \textit{Determining conserved motifs that distinguish high-expressed introns from low-expressed introns with a genetic algorithm on the C. elegans genome}.
