%% Short Version %%
%\item Developed Android app to connect with Arduino via Bluetooth to save and graph measurements from Arduino sensor.
%\item Programmed NI DAQ machines with LabVIEW to obtain periodic thermocouple measurements.

%% Better Highlights Software Abilities %%
\item Programmed Arduino (C) and Android (Java) setup (with HC-05 module) to communicate data measurements via Bluetooth to slash costs and improve portability over wired, proprietary NI DAQ setup.
%\item Programmed \textit{NI DAQ} machines with LabVIEW to poll for temperature measurements from thermocouples and then developed alternative wireless Bluetooth setup with Android and Arduinos.
%\item Developed Android mobile app in Java to connect to an HC-05 Bluetooth chip on Arduino and solicit, graph, and save quantitative data sent via Bluetooth.
%\item Learned 3D printing techniques to print 3D head models obtained by Occipital 3D scanner.
\item Edited 3D scans of human faces with Microsoft 3D Builder for 3D printing.
